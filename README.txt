Code for final project for COMP-599

classifiers/ holds code for running classifiers (this code seems small but it has been changed massively over time. also add weeks of training time for larger LSTMs...)
preprocessing/ holds code for loading text data and formatting then dumping to disk
data/ holds the data (email me if you want it, but be warned, it's about 200GB)
written/ holds all the written work for this project i.e. proposal, paper submission

Please contact me if there are questions about the code. You need these dependencies to run it

Bleeding edge/development edition for:
sklearn
theano
tensorflow
keras
gensim
numpy
scipy
cPickle
CUDA architectures - GPU must be set up as GPU0 in your kernel configuration for tensorflow!

Methods and blocks of code have comments explaining what they do. Most of the work was done in IPython however, using the scripts as reference. I have tried running this on certain computers and sometimes it takes ~30 minutes to make sure everything is set up right.
